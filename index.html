<p>After the completion of this class you will have developed the skills to model,
interpret, simulate, and analyze <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multibody_system">multibody systems</a>, i.e. systems which are
made up of interconnected rigid bodies with arbitrary constraints and applied
loads. Mathematical models of multibody systems are typically very useful at
predicting the motion of macro scale objects. <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion">Newton's laws of motion</a> are
the foundation of developing predictive models of these systems. Examples of
systems you will be able to model are: spacecraft trajectories, human/animal
biomechanics, vehicle motion, robot motion, etc.</p>
<div class="section" id="learning-objectives">
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>formulate a model and free body diagram of multibody systems</li>
<li>incorporate holonomic and nonholonomic constraints into a multibody system</li>
<li>derive the nonlinear and linear equations of motion of a multibody system</li>
<li>simulate the motion of a multibody system with a computer</li>
<li>interpret and analyze the results of simulation</li>
<li>understand and explain notable dynamic phenomena</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prerequisites">
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>We highly recommend taking TU Delft's WB2630 Toets 1: Rigid-Body Dynamics prior
to this course. Otherwise any introductory undergraduate level dynamics course
should suffice. If you haven't had a dynamics course, you can probably get by
if you are motivated and you already know:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Linear algebra</li>
<li>Vector calculus</li>
<li>Calculus based physics</li>
<li>Statics</li>
<li>Introductory numerical methods</li>
<li>Introductory scientific computing</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also be proficient with at least one scientific programming
language. You will be learning and using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> for the class assignments.</p>

<h2>Time and Location</h2>
<p>Lecture videos will be posted online for viewing each Friday, starting February
4, 2022. You will be expected to watch the videos before the work sessions on
Tuesdays. Homework work sessions will occur each week on Tuesdays:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Quarter 3: Tuesdays 13:45-15:45, 3mE-CZ D (James Watt) &amp; Online via MS Teams</li>
<li>Quarter 4: Tuesdays 15:45-17:45, 3mE-CZ D (James Watt) &amp; Online via MS Teams</li>
</ul>
<p>The current coronavirus regulations permit 75 students in the lecture hall at
one time. If you want to attend in-person, you must self sign up for one of the
75 slots on the groups in Brightspace. All others will have to join via
Microsoft Teams for these sessions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="academic-integrity">
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. All homework assignments turned in
for a grade must be your (or you and your partner's) unique work. You may base
your answers off of external materials, but not your classmate's work. If you
work with a partner on homework you must include a contribution explanation
that explains what each student did.</p>
<p>If you make use of code found in other materials that you did not write
yourself, either directly or in a modified form, you must follow the copyright
licenses associated with that material. If there is no copyright license
present, then you must obtain a written and signed permission from the author
of the materials and provide that with your assignment submission. If there is
a copyright license present (e.g. GPL, MIT, BSD, CC-BY), then you must follow
the terms of that license. Most licenses, at minimum, require you to include
the license with your work submission.</p>
<p>All code and written answers will be checked for plagiarism amongst student
submissions and against external materials. Unattributed plagiarized materials
will be marked with a 0 grade.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="course-text-and-materials">
<h2>Course Text and Materials</h2>
<p>The course will be based primarily on provided lecture notes and computational
materials. These will be provided incrementally as we proceed through the
course. The primary principles and notation are based on this freely available
book:</p>
<blockquote>
Thomas R. Kane, and David A. Levinson. Dynamics, Theory and Application.

<p>Note that the book is out of print, but you can download a PDF copy from
Cornell's eCommons digital repository for personal use.</p>
<p>Additionally, some topics will be derived from the following books:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Heike Vallery and Arend L. Schwab, &quot;Advanced Dynamics&quot;, 3rd edition, Delft
University of Technology, 2020, ISBN/EAN 978-90-8309-060-3</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software">
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>We will be making extensive use of the computer aided algebra software <a class="reference external" href="http://sympy.org">SymPy</a>
along with <a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.org">NumPy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://scipy.org">SciPy</a> to model and simulate multibody systems. These
packages are written in the open source Python programming language and
leverage the scientific Python ecosystem of scientific and engineering
computing tools. You will have access to these through Vocareum in Brightspace.
You may also install the software on your own computer. It is recommended that
bring your laptop to the work sessions. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/me41055/software.html">software page</a> on this
website for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assignments-grades">
<h2>Assignments &amp; Grades</h2>
<p>The average of your best 10 of 12 homeworks will be counted for 60% of the
course grade and the exam will count for 40% of the course grade. If the exam
grade is better than the average homework grade or you are taking a resit exam,
then the course grade is 100% from the exam.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Homework</dt>
<dd>There will be 12 computational homework assignments. Homeworks will be made
available via Brightspace-Vocareum one week before they are due. You may
turn in homework as a pair or as an individual. All homework submissions
should be the unique work of the pair or individual. When submitting as a
pair, you must provide a contribution statement explaining the contributions
of each person to the homework.</dd>
<dt>Exam</dt>
<dd>The exam will have a 3 hour duration. You will be able to use any resources
available to you, e.g. books, Jupyter notebooks, websites. Effective use of
the computational tools taught in class will give you the best chance at
succeeding, but they are not necessarily required to succeed.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="brightspace">
<h2>Brightspace</h2>
<p>We will be using several features in Brightspace:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Announcements</dt>
<dd>This will be the instructor's primary communication avenue to you. These
announcements can be forwarded to your TU Delft email address. You are
expected to read these when shared.</dd>
<dt>Discussions</dt>
<dd>All questions for the instructors (or fellow classmates) that are not of a
private nature should be asked in Brightspace discussions. If you need to
discuss something of a private nature with the instructor(s), use email.</dd>
<dt>Grades</dt>
<dd>Homework grades will be posted to Brightspace throughout the duration of the
course.</dd>
<dt>Groups</dt>
<dd>To attend the work sessions in-person, you must sign up for that week's
group. It is first come, first serve for the 75 open slots.</dd>
<dt>Vocareum</dt>
<dd>You will access the homework Jupyter notebook assignments here. You can edit
and execute the notebooks in the Vocareum interface.</dd>
